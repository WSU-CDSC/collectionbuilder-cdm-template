The Kyle Laughlin Photogpraph Collection contains over 800 historical photographs collected or taken by Kyle Laughlin. The Kyle Laughlin photographs were donated to University of Idaho Library Special Collections in February of 1985 by Marguerite Laughlin. The collection was processed and described in 1998 and 1999 by Karen Hertel.

A Moscow resident and businessman for over 50 years, Laughlin took photographs and notes regarding the natural history of the northwest for much of his life.
