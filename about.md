<h3>About the {{site.data.theme.title}}</h3>
<p>Among the riches of the historical photograph collections of the University of Idaho Library is an oversize portfolio of 80 original Carleton E. Watkins photographs.</p>
<p>Long considered lost, these photographs of the interior of four Anaconda Mines in Butte, Montana, were taken in 1890. They show early hard-rock mining techniques, equipment, and men deep underground. </p>
<p>You may browse the collection by location of mine or by depth of the photograph taken. We also provide a series of letters that Watkins sent from Butte to his wife in San Fransisco detailing his working conditions while taking these photographs.</p>
