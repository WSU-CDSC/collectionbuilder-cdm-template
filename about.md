<h3>About the {{site.data.theme.title}}</h3>
<p>Charles Houston Shattuck was a professor in the College of Agriculture (now Natural Resources) who initiated 'Arboretum Hill' (now known as the Charles Houston Shattuck Arboretum). These early twentieth century slides depict the University of Idaho, as well as the wilderness of Idaho and Idaho residents' attempts at domesticating it. </p>
<p>Some of the images in these slides appear in a report from C. H. Shattuck, University of Idaho, Dept. of Forestry to Major F. A. Fenn, Supervisor, Clearwater National Forest (Day-NW SD428.C55S5) and in an article by C. H. Shattuck in the <a href='https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/api/collection/ui_ep/id/3327/download'>UI Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin no. 91, Dec. 1916</a> (Idaho S 53 E416).</p>
