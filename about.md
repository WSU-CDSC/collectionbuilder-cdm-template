<h2>About the Collection</h2>
<h3>The History</h3>
<p>The diffusion of useful and practical, research-based information  on agriculture and related subjects has been a primary responsibility of the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station and University of Idaho Extension since  their beginnings.</p>

<p>The University of Idaho Board of Regents established the  Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station at the UI in 1892 following passage of  the federal Hatch Act (1887), which provided for the creation of agricultural  experiment stations at state land-grant colleges. In addition to stimulating  agricultural research, the act required the publishing of bulletins or reports  of progress on station research and allocated $15,000 per year for conducting  investigations and experiments and printing and distributing the results. </p>
<p>The University of Idaho College of Agriculture started to establish an Extension program in southern Idaho in 1910. In 1914, the  federal Smith-Lever Act authorized cooperative extension work in agriculture  and home economics between the state land-grant institutions and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture. Extension's role was to diffuse practical research-based  information to people not attending college through instruction and practical  demonstrations. Over the years, Extension's mandate grew to include gardening,  natural resources, youth development, and community development.</p>

<h3>The Content</h3>
<p>This collection encompasses the research-based publishing of  the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station and University of Idaho Extension  since their inceptions. Experiment station publishing started almost  immediately in 1892 with a series of bulletins that ran until 1954. Extension publishing began in 1912 with a series of bulletins that ran until 1953. A new  series of University of Idaho College of Agriculture bulletins began in 1953, starting  with number 200, with contributions coming either from the Idaho Agricultural  Experiment Station or the Idaho Agricultural Extension Service. A series of  shorter College of Agriculture publications, the current information series,  began in 1964 with titles from both the experiment station and extension. A  series of highly technical research bulletins published by the Idaho Agricultural  Experiment Station, the research bulletins, began in 1922.</p>
<p>Starting in the mid-1990s, experiment station and Extension  publications were published on the Internet in PDF format as well as in print.  By 2010, the vast majority of Extension and experiment station publications  were available only online, for free access by all.</p>
