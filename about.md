                <p>While primarily known for his jazz critiques and silver-tongued writing style on the jazz scene, Leonard Feather also played a pivotal role in helping to break down many gender and racial preconceptions in the Jazz world. For his "Blindfold Tests," Feather would invite artists and well-known participants in the Jazz community to listen to a series of songs without telling them who was playing or any details about the record. Often, artists would think they heard one musician, claiming that the way they played sounded like one color or one gender, only to find out that they were wrong. Several of these blindfold tests were printed in both <em>Metronome</em> and <em>DownBeat</em> magazines.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>Feather documented the lives and opinions of Jazz artists in many ways. In 1955, he published the first
                edition of his <em>Encyclopedia of Jazz</em>, which offered not only biographies of thousands of artists but also
                musical analyses and studies of the relationship of jazz to classical music. De Capo Press published four
                volumes of his <em>Encyclopedia</em>, and condensed his two yearbooks (featuring record industry trends and
                demographics as well as biographies of critics and DJs) into a single volume. His Encyclopedia is still
                referenced today as an invaluable educational tool for jazz enthusiasts and performers, and Feather
                was working on a comprehensive <em>Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz</em> with Ira Gitler up until his death in
                1994. While some of the articles had minor flaws (mostly birthdates), Feather’s <em>Encyclopedia of Jazz</em> and
                his earlier <em>Inside Bebop</em>, solidified his place in the jazz world as an acclaimed composer and evenly fair
                jazz critic.</p>

        <h3>Blindfold Test Collection</h3>
        <p>We present here a collection of Leonard Feather's Blindfold Test recordings. Below, you'll find a recording of Dizzy Gillespie's Blindfold Test with Feather from 1958, in addition to a two transcribed tests that were published in <em>Metronome</em> magazine in 1947.  In these two tests, Feather played the same set of songs for <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/1272356-Buddy-Weed">Buddy Weed</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Basie">Count Basie</a> Their guesses are published below, along with the answers for each of 13 prompts. Unfortunately, we do not have a recording of this test.

        <p>In this month’s and next month’s issues, The Blindfold Test is making a departure which should prove interesting. The same set of records has been played to two musicians—both of them jazz pianists, but far removed from each other in the spheres in which they work and in the music to which they generally listen.</p>
        <p>Next month you will be able to read what Count Basie thinks of the records reviewed on this page. The comments below represent the reactions of Buddy Weed, the talented young pianist and singer that you know through his broadcasts over ABC with his own trio as well as with Paul Whiteman, and through his MGM records. Here’s what Buddy had to say:</p>

    <div class="col-md-6 mt-3">
        <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Count Basie</strong></h4>
        <p>If you read last month’s issue, you know that what follows is the second half of a special pair of blindfold tests. The same group of records was played to two musicians: Buddy Weed, radio network pianist and trio-leader, who listens only to classical records in his spare time; and Count Basie, jump pianist and traveling band-leader who listens to plenty of jazz.</p>
        <p>Buddy’s comments on the records appeared last month. Below you can see what happened when I spun the same discs for the bland, easy-going <a href="http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/search/collection/lfc/searchterm/Basie/field/all/mode/all/conn/and/">Count</a>, who hates to say a bad word about anybody — not for professional courtesy or shrewd business relations, but simply because he’s an exceptionally kind-hearted guy who likes all kinds of music and all kinds of people.</p>
