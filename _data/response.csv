"That's got to be Dizzy… sounds cleaner here than in most of his large band numbers. Bass very good; ensemble execution better than most I've heard of that kind. If it's Dizzy on trumpet, I've heard him play better… Bebop? Let's eliminate classifications - either music is good or it isn't. Three stars.","Bass is really wonderful . . . reed section very outstanding… trumpet solo, great performance. That's true bebop, the record in general. That's a whole bebop record, isn't it? 'Cause I really don't know what bebop is. I'd like to know what band that was - sounds like the boss, Dizzy. But Red Rodney plays terrific like that too. Arrangement very interesting - tells a story from start to finish. Four stars.",194706_001,"Dizzy Gillespie, One Bass Hit, Part II (Musicraft). Ray Brown, bass; Gillespie, trumpet; Arr. Ray Brown."
"Sam Donahue - I heard his V Disc of this arrangement, and it was very much more impressive played by his navy band than it sounds with this band… pretty sloppy here, doesn't get a beat. . . I like the taste of the trombone, piano good - is that Rocky Coluccio? Others nothing to rave about. Two Stars","Now there's a real nice simple record . . . I go for things that are real simple like that. Easy to listen to, easy to dance to, pat your feet to; one of my favorite tunes - first time I ever heard it treated like that. Solos are relaxed, easy. A solid record - no idea who it is. Four stars.",194706_002,"Sam Donahue, Dinah (Capitol)."
Not impressed at all. Full of a lot of clichés. Pianist is handicapped by lack of technique; others are not too inspired. One star.,"I hope the guys will forgive me for this-that first chorus is messed up. They're not together. Piano nice; trumpet fairly good - tenor plays like Pres. Conversation between the trumpet and tenor didn't hold up too well. I think if they'd made it over, they'd have done this better. The best thing on it is the fine bass work. Two stars.",194706_003,"Dexter Gordon, Dexter Digs In (Savoy). Gordon, tenor; Leonard Hawkins, trumpet; Bud Powell, piano; Curley Russell, bass."
"Oh yes, the METRONOME All Stars . . . opening baritone solo not too impressive. I like the way Nat sings; other singer is the girl from Kenton's band; I've heard her much better . . . there aren't two pianists on that date, are there? Play that piano-drum answer passage again . . . no, guess I was mistaken. I liked the bass; and naturally Buddy Rich needs no introduction -- has as much flash as anybody in the business today. I heard Shavers, Rogers, and some others. Altogether there's no excuse for the whole record. It's unfair to throw all those star men in together and try to cram too many solos in. Two stars.",Everything is wonderful about this. Harry Carney; Lawrence Brown; sounds like one of those Buddy Rich breaks . . . In a way that male vocal sounded like King. No idea who the girl was; or the trumpet. Alto sounded like Johnny Hodges. Fine record-four stars.,194706_004,"Metronome All Stars, Nat Meets June (Columbia). Harry Carney, baritone; Nat Cole, June Christy, vocals; Buddy Rich, drums; Charlie Shavers, trumpet; Johnny Hodges, alto; Lawrence Brown, trombone."
Barnet isn't it? Bill Miller on piano . . . sounds as though this was written as a piano solo number and he's trying to play it as originally written; no ideas of his own come through. This must have been made some time ago; I recognize it but don't know the name. Doesn't sound too good to me now - lack of cleanliness in the band and section work . . . let me hear the trumpet again . . . I like that. I'll be good and say two stars.,"This sounds like an old shout I used to hear years ago; something Duke did. Sounds very heavy, very solid. I like the solos. Arrangement varies just a little from the original, still it's the next best to Duke. Whoever played the piano sounded almost like Duke. Three stars.",194706_005,"Charlie Barnet, Birmingham Breakdown (Bluebird). Bill Miller, piano; Bobby Burnet, trumpet; Duke Ellington composition."
"Is this Ventura with Krupa? . . . no, that was only guess . . . that baritone solo is very cute, very characteristic of baritone sax. I like the trombone; reminiscent of Bill Harris. The band is very unclean; tenor was very exciting. First part might have been an old record until it got to the solos, then you could tell it was recent. Might be Basie's band. Record as a whole not so hot, but for the tenor solo it's worth three stars.","Sounds like my boy on tenor. To me he's always good. Of course people will talk about those high notes, but you know, there's tricks to everything . . . though Jacquet can play as much solid horn as anybody else . . . he must have put this band together just for the record-like building a house; but it does the best job possible under the circumstances. Rhythm section sounds fine; drums are in my taste. Baritone is real great, and that wonderful trombone knocked me out. Record ends just as I expected. For the soloists this would be worth four, but on the whole, three stars.",194706_006,"Illinois Jacquet, Jivin' With Jack The Bellboy (Aladdin). Jacquet, tenor; Leo Parker, baritone sax; Dickie Wells, trombone; Shadow Wilson, drums."
"Wow! . . . that's just not my kind of music, I guess. I just don't like it. There are probably people who think that because it's old it's good - there must be some reason for them to keep the record around this long and re-press it. Wrong chord changes, bad recording, everything . . . clarinet player has a little originality. Stars? How few can you give it? Zero. What? Recorded only five years ago? . . . oh, no! . . . make it minus zero!","Do you have to play this all the way through? . . . Well, I won't stick my neck out; this music stands for something, but as it is now, it seem quite a bit webby. Do I hear a banjo? . . . there's no comparison with the kids playing today - time has just walked right by these guys. It's like comparing a 1904 automobile with a new model. Back when this music was really played, it was great; but anybody who can see it now is just kidding himself - just wants to have something to say. I won't rate this one.",194706_007,"Bunk Johnson, When I Leave The World Behind (Jazz Information). Bunk, trumpet; Lawrence Marrero, banjo."
"Tenor is wonderful. Piano sounded like Count, though I've heard Johnny Guarnieri play that much like him. Trumpet not too great. Clarinet - let me hear him again . . . sounds to me like Hank d'Amico, but he has much more fluency today. Rhythm sounds good. For what this is - just a bunch of solos - it stands up well. Three stars.","Sounds like my boy Johnny . . . that was real cute . . . I can close my eyes and almost say that tenor was Pres . . . trumpet fine, clarinet wonderful. A good record - it tells a little story. Four stars.",194706_008,"Johnny Guarnieri, Basie English (Savoy). Guarnieri, piano; Lester Young, tenor; Billy Butterfield, trumpet; Hank d'Amico, clarinet."
"I don't know. I'm just not partial to those styles. The record does seem to move, in its own Dixieland fashion. Piano has good drive; I just don't like what he plays. Very loud drummer… sounds like a soprano sax; could be Bechet - I don't know the styles of that school too well. Two stars.","Sounds like Zutty . . . and that must be fine old man Sidney Bechet; I have an awful lot of respect for him - he always sounds interesting to me. Piano sounds like Basie-very webbish-very corny. He and I should play a duet together- we can't keep up with the modern kids . . . rhythm section fits, for the type stuff they're playing. The old man rates four, but for the record, two stars.",194706_009,"Joe Sullivan, Panama (Disc.) Sullivan, piano; Bechet, soprano; Geo. Wettling, drums."
"It's always a source of amazement to me that people could hear Louis play like that and still have their adoration for things like Bunk Johnson. Louis always played with as much drive, originality, freshness and smoothness as anything you'd want to hear today; it doesn't pall even today, while these other inferior musicians, whose work has palled so badly, are being worshipped. I don't know how old this is - not too new judging from the rhythm section. Clarinet is definitely dated; trombone better, but overshadowed by Louis's great playing and singing. Assuming it's old, and for what it was then, four stars. Recorded only a year ago? . . . well, it's still great, but make it three stars.","That sounds like little Vicky there on trombone . . . Barney's there too. And Pops, of course. How does he sound? Well, how does he always sound? Four stars.",194706_0010,"Louis Armstrong, Sugar (Victor). Louis, trumpet and vocal; Barney Bigard, clarinet; Vic Dickenson, trombone."
Piano very strongly influenced by Tatum . . . it wouldn't be that mythical Dodo Marmarosa I've heard so much about but never heard? Nobody else ever came this close to Tatum. . . is the tenor man playing the tune purposely or couldn't he think of anything else to play? I didn't like the clarinet . . . guitar fairly interesting . . . hearing that Tatum run was the most interesting thing on this . . . rating? . . . now I'm beginning to see the difficulty of being a critic . . . two stars.,"Cute little theme . . . sounds like the boss on piano - Teddy Wilson. Clarinet boy is my boy Ed Hall- he always plays fine. Guitar wonderful . . . there's the old man, Coleman, or a carbon copy, which is very fine . . . only thing, I didn't care for what was going on behind the solos. It would have been just as good without them. Three stars.",194706_0011,"Esquire All Stars, Esquire Bounce (Commodore). Tatum, piano; Coleman Hawkins, tenor; Edmond Hall, clarinet; Al Casey, guitar."
"Guitar very unusual; play that bit again; I like his use of the lower strings . . . like the trumpet too; a little like Shavers, but doesn't knock himself out as much as Charlie . . . tenor good; not too impressed by the piano . . . bit like the Count, but he does things he wouldn't. I take it that was Zutty on drums; play the introduction again - oh, of course! Fats. There are a lot of good parts in this; I'd give it three stars.","I heard this in the picture, didn't I? . . . Starts out real great . . . Fats and Zutty and Slam . . . who's that wonderful trumpet? . . . that trombone in the last ensemble knocks me out. Give that four stars, please!",194706_0012,"Fats Waller, Moppin"" and Boppin' (Victor). Benny Carter, trumpet; Zutty Singleton, drums; Fats Waller, piano; Gene Porter, tenor; Slim Moore, trombone."
"That's Fats . . . trumpet good; don't know who it is. Was this made before the era of the electric guitar? Interesting guitar, anyway . . . I used to think a great deal of Fats, listened to all his stuff faithfully, but somehow listening now I think a lot less of him . . . two stars.","James P. Johnson, Hot Harlem (Stinson-Asch). Johnson, piano; Frank Newton, trumpet; Al Casey, guitar; Eddie Dongherty, drums.",194706_0013,"Ragtime piano player - patterned on Fats. Idea is cute, especially the real Fats introduction and piano. Nice drum break . . . trumpet sounds like Sidney de Paris. Guitar okay. Nothing terrific here. Two stars."
