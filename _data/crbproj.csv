Dworshak Dam will be a concrete gravity dam with an initial power production potentially of 400,000 kilowatts from three generators. Three additional generators can be added later to boost the power output to 1,060,000 kilowatts. Dworshak dam will create a reservoir storing 3,454,000 acre-feet of water and will add substantially to the prime power production of hydroelectric plants downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. Also, it will serve a vital role in flood control on the Clearwater, which has wide fluctuations in flow during the year. The Dworshak reservoir will be approximately 53 miles long. Congress appropriated $600,000 in planning funds in 1961 and in 1962 Congress appropriated $2,000,000 in construction funds.

The solenoid operated valve at the top transmits pulsating waves through the system to assist in the removal of air in the tubes. Two TK Westinghouse relays at the bottom are electrically connected in series with the solenoid valve. Any cycle desired for the operation of solenoid valve can be obtained by adjustments of the timing devices in the relays.
