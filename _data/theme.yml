description: 'Jazz critic Leonard Feather was famous for conducting "Blindfold Tests," sessions in which he would invite jazz musicians and well-known participants in the jazz community to listen to a series of songs without telling them who was playing or any details about the record. In order to transcribe these tests and publish them in jazz journals, Feather would record these listening sessions with musicians. This collection is comprised of 33 of those recordings.'
