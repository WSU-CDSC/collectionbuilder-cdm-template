Readme for Stanton Gilbert Fisher

Metadata:

Some weirdness with dates that needs to be addressed:
-disparate multiple dates for any one item
-some brackets in there

Titles could also use some improvement or standardization when dealing with multiples. -Suggest trying to find more descriptive titles versus putting numerical sequence (example title: Chief Joseph [1] --> Sitting portrait of Chief Joseph circa [date])

-needs creation of subject metadata for word cloud page

-about has a stub but will need more

Theme/Config:

-shut off browse subjects for now
-removed map because no info on it for now

Second Revision for Site on August 13, 2019
