# Notes

## Metadata

- Subjects need to be improved. They are all just "Forestry", while every image could benefit from some subject classification.  Species names, common names, people, places, concepts, lots of stuff.
- Changed location to subject, since it is the LCSH headings and the only thing unique that resembles a subject.
- Changed subject to subject (useless)

## Other thoughts

- Going to need to be responsively designed.  The about page uses a simple floating mechanism to make the three columns work, but I don't know that that is appropriate in the grid system.
