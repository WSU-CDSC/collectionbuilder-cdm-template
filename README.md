# CollectionBuilder CONTENTdm

This version of CollectionBuilder is used by the University of Idaho Library to create skins for the digital libary collections they maintain via a hosted CONTENTdm instance. 

To do so, librarians and staff work with a clean version of a single collection's metadata, as stored in a .csv document linked via this Jekyll repository's [_config.yml](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template/blob/master/_config.yml) file. They then adjust various settings using the [_data/theme.yml](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template/blob/master/_data/theme.yml). 

See the [Mark Brooks Calnon Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/calnon/index.html_ for an example of a finished collection using this tool. 

While this tool was built specifically for use at the University of Idaho Library, it should also be usable by any other CONTENTdm using institution. We intend to further refine this and related CollectionBuilder tools over the course of the next year, adding a great deal more documentation and guides for the tool's use.
